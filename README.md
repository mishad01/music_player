## Features
- **Top Player Section**: View current song details, control playback, and scrub through the track with a progress slider.
- **Song List**: Browse available songs with their track number, title, and artist.
- **Seamless Playback**: Instant playback updates when selecting a song from the list, with state synchronized across the app.
- **Audio Controls**: Play, pause, skip forward, or go back to the previous track effortlessly.

## Architecture
This project follows **Clean Architecture** combined with a **Feature-based** folder structure. It enforces a strict separation of concerns into distinct layers:
- **Core**: Contains app-wide constants (colors, strings, etc.) and shared utilities.
- **Domain**: Houses core business logic and entities (e.g., `Song` object).
- **Data**: Manages data models and data sources (e.g., hardcoded sample songs).
- **Presentation**: Manages the UI layer, organized by screen/feature (e.g., `home`), including its widgets and state providers.

## Tech Stack
- **Flutter** & **Dart**
- **audioplayers**: Core engine for audio playback.
- **http**: For resolving external media URLs.
- **provider**: For robust, reactive state management.

## Getting Started
